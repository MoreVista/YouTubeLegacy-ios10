# YouTubeLegacy

YouTubeLegacy attempts to make old YouTube versions work again. It works from YouTube version 16.32.6+.

## List of mitigations

- You may have to play a video by tapping on the vertical triple dots button and selecting "Play"
- You can select another account by tapping on the vertical triple dots button in "You" tab


## Notes

CydiaSubstrate is usually broken on iOS 12 jailbreaks. This may cause false positives where the tweak is not working as expected. Consider switching to Substitute or Libhooker instead. Alternatively, switch to a different jailbreak that has Substitute or Libhooker built-in.
